# Intro

this is my current repo for my final project (portfolio) submission for my 'development for the web' course

this project will be gradually built upon after the course's end alongside my current artist portfolio that's been in development for the past year (using WordPress, hosting on Bluehost)

both sites will be worked on as I explore which site and method are best suited for my personal/career goals and build my webdev skills out of passion.
